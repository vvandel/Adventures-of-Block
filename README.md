**Adventures of Block**

This game is developed for the research project "The Use of Music Anticipation in Games" by Ivar Troost and Twan Veldhuis.

The contents of this repository, with exception of the file "lightning.png" and certain code obtained from StackOverflow are licensed by the MIT license (LICENSE.md). 

This repository contains two main independent branches (tags):  

- Master (v1.0 release):  
The project as used in the research from 2016. Level selection is done using Test codes so that participants are ignorant about which level they play in which order.

- Game (v2.0 develop):  
The project as extended after the research to be released as a game.
This contains a level definition script (non-hardcoded levels), a fail-state (health), and a changed level selection screen where users can freely pick the level.
This branch is in an unfinished state.
